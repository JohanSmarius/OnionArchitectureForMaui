# Onion Architecture For .NET Maui

This repository contains a lightweight implementation of the Onion Architecture for .NET MAUI.
The Onion Architecture is designed to make the codebase more 
maintainable and scalable by separating the application into 
layers based on their responsibilities. 
Furthermore, testability is a key aspect of the Onion Architecture.

The code shows how you can update the more common MVVM architecture 
into the Onion Architecture. The starting point for the code change is placed
in the xx branch. The final code is placed in the main branch.
